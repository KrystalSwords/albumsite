# Krystal's Catalogue

A database of all of my favorite albums. On the front end, users can browse the catalogue by artist, see details of specific albums, get recommended a random album based on genre, create user profiles, and more to come. 

Made with React, Node.js/Express, and MySQL.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies, then run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
